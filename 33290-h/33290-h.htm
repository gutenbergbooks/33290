PREFACE.
</H3>

<P>
This little Manual is intended for the use of young people, and is
therefore short and very simple.  The object of the compiler is to
place in the hands of candidates for Confirmation a little book that
may be a help to them in their daily life, as well as at the Service of
Holy Communion.
</P>

<P>
Grateful thanks are tendered to the holders of copyright for permission
to make use of the hymns printed at the end of the book.  Also, the
author begs to acknowledge ideas derived from examining similar
Manuals, especially "The Narrow Way," "Prayers for Boys," "Help to
Worship," and "Holy Communion" by Bishop How.
</P>

<P>
It is earnestly hoped that this little book may, with the blessing of
God, prove of service to those for whom it has been written, both in
helping their devotions, and in deepening their spiritual life.

FOREWORD
</H3>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
BY THE RIGHT REVEREND MacADAM HARDING,
<BR>
BISHOP OF QU'APPELLE.
</H4>

<P>
A little book that will help the young and busy people in North-West
Canada to pray earnestly, day by day, and regularly make a good
Communion, must receive a warm welcome from the Bishop of a Diocese
where the great majority of the people are both young and busy.
</P>

<P>
I know the earnest desire of the compiler to help our young men and
women to draw near to God in Prayer and Sacrament, and I hope many of
them will find herein the very assistance they need.

PREPARATION FOR HOLY COMMUNION.
</H3>

<P>
St. Paul says, "Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that
Bread, and drink of that Cup."
</P>

<P>
You must guard against the danger of coming carelessly and without
preparation to Holy Communion; so make a rule to always examine
yourself carefully before you come.
</P>

<P>
First kneel down and say:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
O God, Thou knowest everything that I have said, and thought, and done.
Help me now to examine myself, that I may see my sins and be sorry for
them.  Send Thy Holy Spirit into my heart to help me, for Jesus
Christ's sake.  Amen.
</P>

<P>
Then ask yourself:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
1.  Am I trying to love and serve God with all my heart?
</P>

<P>
2.  Have I fallen into any special sin, which is troubling my mind, and
keeping me back from God?
</P>

<P>
3.  Have I said my prayers reverently and carefully every night and
morning?
</P>

<P>
4.  Have I been to Church every Sunday, and kept the rest of the day as
I ought?
</P>

<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P15"></A>15}</SPAN>

<P>
5.  Have I tried to forgive any who may have done me a wrong?
</P>

<P>
6.  Have I done anything impure, or said anything impure, or encouraged
any impure thought?
</P>

<P>
7.  Have I been honest in everything?
</P>

<P>
8.  Have I always told the truth?
</P>

<P>
9.  Have I thought or spoken evil of another?
</P>

<P>
10.  Have I quarrelled with any one, or lost my temper?
</P>

<P>
11.  Is there any sin I am not willing to give up?
</P>

<P>
12.  Have I been regular in my times of receiving the Holy Communion?
</P>

<P>
Whenever you find you have been wrong, confess your fault to God, and
ask for his pardon; say:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
O Father Almighty, forgive me for this sin that I have committed, and
send down Thy Holy Spirit into my heart that I may do better in the
future, for Jesus Christ's sake.  Amen.
</P>

<P>
[<I>If you have any trouble in your mind, or cannot quiet your own
conscience, either from some sin that you have committed, or from doubt
as to whether you ought to come to Holy Communion, do not be afraid to
go to your Clergyman, and ask him to help you</I>.]
</P>

<P>
<I>Also on Saturday night or Sunday morning use the following Office of
Preparation</I>:&mdash;
</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>
I am truly sorry, O Lord, that I have grieved Thee by my sins, and I
wish that my sorrow was far greater.  I am not worthy to be called Thy
child, but Thou art still my most merciful Father.  Make me to hate sin
and to long for holiness: for Jesus' sake.  Amen.
</P>

<P>
I love Thee, O my God, for all Thy mercy to me, and I desire to love
Thee more and more.  Let no earthly love possess my heart, so as to let
me forget Thee.  Give me Thy Holy Spirit that I may love Thee more
truly, for Jesus Christ's sake.  Amen.
</P>

<P>
O Heavenly Father, I am about to draw near to the most Holy Sacrament
of the Body and Blood of Thy dear Son.  Have mercy upon me; have mercy
upon me, for I am most unworthy.  But, O my God, look not upon my sin,
but look upon the Face of Thy Son.  Thy dear Son hath died that we may
come with boldness unto Thee.  Therefore I come.  Oh, may I so eat and
drink that I may be partaker of the Body and Blood of Christ to the
strengthening and refreshing of my soul, and may be one with Him
through the power of the Holy Spirit.  Hear me, and
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P17"></A>17}</SPAN>
accept me, O
most merciful Father, for the sake of the same my crucified Saviour.

<P>
Cleanse Thou me, O Lord, from my secret faults, and mercifully pardon
my sins, that I may receive Thy holy gifts with a pure mind; through
Jesus Christ our Lord.  Amen.

<P>
Almighty and everlasting God, I come to the holy Sacrament of Thy dear
Son.  I draw near weak, to the Giver of Strength; unclean, to the
Fountain of Mercy; blind, to the Eternal Light; poor and needy, to the
Lord of heaven and earth.  I pray Thee, therefore, of Thy great
goodness, to have mercy upon me, that so I may receive the King of
kings, and Lord of lords, with such reverence and purity and faith, as
shall be for the health of my soul.  Let me now receive the Body and
Blood of Jesus my Lord, that I may be one Body and one Spirit with Him,
and ever remain among His members.  Grant this for the same Jesus
Christ's sake.  Amen.
</P>

<P>
I do not presume to come to Thy table, O merciful Lord, trusting in my
own righteousness, but in
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P18"></A>18}</SPAN>
Thy manifold and great mercies.  I am
not worthy so much as to gather up the crumbs under Thy table.  But
Thou art the same Lord, Whose property is always to have mercy: Grant
me therefore, gracious Lord, so to eat the Flesh of Thy dear Son Jesus
Christ, and to drink His Blood, that my sinful body may be made clean
by His Body, and my soul washed through His most precious Blood, and
that I may evermore dwell in Him and He in me.  Amen.

O Blessed Saviour Jesus Christ, not trusting in my own goodness, but in
Thy great merits, I desire to receive the holy Sacrament of Thy Body
and Blood.  I am stained with many sins; do Thou wash me in Thy
precious Blood.  I am faint and weary in my strife against sin; do Thou
refresh and strengthen me.  Give me perfect purity of soul and body;
drive from me all unholy thoughts, and keep me from every evil word and
deed.  Give me grace to draw near to this holy Sacrament with such
reverence and fear, such holy joy and fervent love, such sorrow for sin
and desires for holiness, that I may enjoy all the blessings and
receive all the benefits which Thou hast obtained for us through Thy
precious death.  Amen.
